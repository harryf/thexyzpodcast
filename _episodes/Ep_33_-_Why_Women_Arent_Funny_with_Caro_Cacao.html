    <span class="description"><p>This week the boys are joined by good friend and fellow comedienne Caro Cacao ( @_carocacao_ ) who brings with her the most triggering topic yet (i.e. it was her idea - don't blame us!) ... "Why Women Aren't Funny". Chaos and insanity ensues. Warning: if you are easily triggered... why are you even listening to this podcast?!?</p>
